## WrapSix ToDo 
#####

== First stage ==
* basic skeleton
* configuration
* purely mediate function of DNS resolver -> implement it's protocol
( write some test scripts )

== Second stage ==
- stay as a DNS wrapping resolver - create faked AAAA entries instead of A
    (only if AAAA is required)
- running with arguments

== Third stage ==
- listen on all ports & all set IPv6 addresses
- wrap all connections to IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses

== ... ==

== Final stage ==
- choose a licence ;c)
- test a lot
- revise documentation
- create a package with some simple installator

== Optional stage ==
- implement cache for DNS
- create man pages
- create some home web page (may be a wiki?)

== PostFinal stage ==
- optimise
  - translation_ip.c -> don't translate IPv6 to IPv4 through a string
- rewrite DNS wrapping resolver into C
