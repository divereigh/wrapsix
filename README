WrapSix
=======

About
-----
WrapSix is a fast NAT64 implementation. You also need a DNS64 server (e.g. BIND).

Before compiling, don't forget to configure Wrapsix in files src/wrapper.c and
src/wrapper.h.

Configuration
-------------
INTERFACE	Interface on which WrapSix should operate, e.g. eth0.
PREFIX		NAT64 prefix; at least /96, the default is standard
		64:ff9b::/96. Input it without the information about prefix
		length, i.e. just 64:ff9b::.
IPV4_ADDR	IPv4 address which is dedicated for WrapSix and is not assigned
		to the host operating system.
HOST_IPV6_ADDR	IPv6 address which represents the host, i.e. which is assigned
		to the operating system. It's used in ICMP error messages.
HOST_IPV4_ADDR	IPv4 address which represents the host, i.e. which is assigned
		to the operating system. It's used in ICMP error messages.
MTU		Minimum MTU in your IPv6 network; default is 1280, but you can
		set it to a greater value (up to 1500).
PACKET_BUFFER	Size of a buffer for incoming packets; it's strongly recommended
		to leave its value as is (i.e. 1514).

Installation
------------
For installation use standard ./configure && make && make install commands.

Running
-------
It can be run by `wrapsix` command as root.
