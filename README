About
-----
WrapSix is a fast NAT64 implementation. You also need a DNS64 server (e.g. BIND).

Before compiling, don't forget to configure Wrapsix in files src/wrapper.c.

Configuration
-------------
HOST_IPV6_ADDR	IPv6 address which represents the host, i.e. which is assigned
		to the operating system. It's used in ICMP error messages.
HOST_IPV4_ADDR	IPv4 address which represents the host, i.e. which is assigned
		to the operating system. It's used in ICMP error messages.

WrapSix uses configuration file wrapsix.conf from configuration directory set in
"./configure" phase, which is by default /usr/local/etc.

Installation
------------
For installation use standard ./configure && make && make install commands.
